[X] cairo (too low level)
[X] skia (too low level. try blink.)
[X] imageMagick (not fully implemented)
[X] chromium (too low level. try blink.) (for help, consider researching electron, webkit.js, iridium, [https://electronjs.org/blog/electron-internals-building-chromium-as-a-library])
[X] blink (pathologicalable perf) (too complex. not modular. cannot get render code without all dom functions and platform dependent code)
[X] html2canvas new version (svg parser incomplete)
[-] webkit (pathologicalable perf) (https://github.com/WebKit/webkit/tree/master/Source/WebCore/svg) (no shadows???)
[X] html2canvas (patching seems to mess up rendering) (fixing perf indicates this is slow af)
[-] wxsvg (no mask and clippath)
[X] batik (mostly accurate, but very slow)
librsvg (inaccurate??)
fabric.js {patch parser}
webkit (direct render to canvas) (no shadows???)
[-] blink (direct render to canvas)
[X] two.js (https://github.com/jonobr1/two.js)
svgl (no mask?)
svgren (likely lacklustre support)

Stop Gap:
direct canvas rendering

Long Run:
[O] fabric.js (js; high impact)
librsvg (wiki: high impact)
