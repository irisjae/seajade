can't render imgs, text

how to load imgs, text?
inline them.
	like this for fonts:
		to make fonts into URI: https://github.com/mnjul/webfont-loader-with-progress/blob/master/loader.js
		to make URI into inlined: https://stackoverflow.com/questions/37083459/html-use-an-svg-image-which-contains-a-custom-font
		or this: 
	like this for images: https://stackoverflow.com/questions/7650587/using-javascript-to-display-blob
	misc:
		general usage of createObjectURl: https://developers.google.com/web/updates/2012/06/Don-t-Build-Blobs-Construct-Them
			and: https://developers.google.com/web/updates/2012/06/Don-t-Build-Blobs-Construct-Them
		
		 




misc features:
	render/inline styles as well
		(is this already done using drawImage?
			more accurately; are styles applied to an image string? no, i think. maybe thats why its fast.
			which svgs shouldnt have anyway
			so just avoid it.
		)
	add basic 3d support: https://github.com/ndebeiss/svg3d
	syncing with dom'ed layer
